In‑app dylib injection with CoreTrust bypass and opainject.<br>
Titanium lets you pick a target process, optionally choose a custom `.dylib`, re‑sign it with a CoreTrust bypass, and inject it into the process on‑device.<br>
Expected to work on iOS versions supported by TrollStore (roughly iOS 14.0 – 17.0) when running with appropriate platform entitlements.<br>

---

## Build
- Uses Theos.
- Clone the repo and run:
```sh
make package
```
- Resulting Titanium.tipa will be placed in packages/.<br>
PRs and improvements are welcome.

---

## Tested

- Device: iPhone 11 Pro (arm64e)
- Targets: Multiple stock App Store apps
- Notes: Injection tested on real App Store-signed binaries, running on-device via TrollStore with appropriate entitlements.

---

> ⭐ If this repo gets enough stars, I’ll look into adding injection support for system daemons and apps.
